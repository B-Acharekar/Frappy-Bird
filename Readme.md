# Flappy Bird - Bugged Edition 🐦💀

A totally *functional* Flappy Bird clone made in Unity.  
Play it... if you dare. 😈

## About the Game
Developed in **2023**, then *almost completely forgotten*... until now.  
Instead of letting it rot, why not just publish it? 💀  

## Known "Features" (Bugs)
- ❌ **No Exit Button** – ALT + F4 is your best friend.  
- 🛠 **Lazy Bird Syndrome** – Spacebar works... but the bird lacks the will to jump.  
- 🎮 **Random Gravity Madness** – Feels like the bird is questioning life choices mid-air.  

## How to Play
1. Download & run the game.  
2. Try (and fail) to make the bird fly.  
3. Rage quit and come back for more.

💀 *You have been warned. Enjoy!* 💀
